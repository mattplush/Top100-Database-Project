In the original chart csv file there were 97 columns, which included 8 written by columns and 75 position columns. In creating the initial top100 table in MySQL, we created a table that included all the original columns and loaded the csv into that table. From this top100 table I created 4 different tables to represent the different entities in the database. The first table I created was the people table which includes a "person's" ID and their name (including bands). This table is used to represent both artists and writers. The next table I created was the tracks table, which holds all information about a given track including the artist ID which is a foreign key to a specific person. Tracks can only have 1 artist but may have many writers. Because of the many-to-many relationship between writers and tracks, I needed to create a wrote table, which includes a track ID, person ID, and a sequence integer, which keeps track of the number of writers belonging to a specific track. The final table I created is the position table, which includes a foreign key referencing a specific track, the week, date, and position. This table was used so that we no longer needed 75 different position columns. You can now find a track's position data by referencing its ID and one of the fields in the table. The 4 newly created tables ensure that the database is in 3NF.
