Your choice! Come up a question similar to those above, but not simply changing a
detail, like the year... thatâ€™s too easy. Look for some data that can be solved by a query on
your normalized database, that contains a result which (a) requires the joining of two or more
tables, and (b) is sorted on some field or fields, and (c) is not identical/similar to a Graduate
query below. Be creative! This one is worth extra points, see the rubric!

first with 59 number ones.
