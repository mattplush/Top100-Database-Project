Use an SQL query to ascertain what 2 songs were on the chart the longest in 1972, and
show the answer and the result table that provided the answer... you need not have SQL print
the isolated specific answer if the result table shows multiple sorted answers. NOTE: use the
position dates within 1972, not the track year for this one!
